      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi and nice to meet you! </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Minneapolis MN</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy playing video games, making noises that some would consider music, and eating copious amounts of pastries from the bakery where I currently work. I also love spending time with animals; especially my pet gecko Yoshi, who tolerates me. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p> Being paid to play with dogs. I studied to become a veterinarian for a while becasue that was the closest thing I could think of, but it was smelly and gross and involved too many animal bodily fluids. So I decided to hang up my scrubs, disinfect myself, and finish my degree in English instead.  </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Chicago IL</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'd like to be a web developer becasue I like creative problem solving and building things. I love turing ideas into tangible finished products, and web development seems like a great way to do that.  I also think my skills in writing could be helpful in a career as a web developer; I'd love to be able to create a website as well as write the content.     </p>
